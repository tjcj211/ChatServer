A breakdown of the work that each member of the team did, what parts were contributed by that individual.
    Timothy Carta
        - Created server using InventoryServer as a base
        - Made client connect to server
        - Made information pass between client and server
        - Added Room selection option
        - Made it so that when one cleint sends a message, all other clients recieve
        - Entering and exiting is broadcast to clients
        - Comments throughout ChatServer.java
        - Client can change rooms
        - Added logging. I am not sure if logging generally will remove the old log, so that is how I implemented it
        - Server disconnects client when they exit

A description of how the tasks were divided out among the members.
    We created a group chat adn split the team into two subteams. The team that would work on the client and the team that would work on the server.
    People were allowed to pick which requirements they wanted to try to implement.
